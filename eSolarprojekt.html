             <h2> <b> Installation of a solar panel system for our partner school </b> </h2> 
            Solar project of the 11th grade students.
        
         
        
        <br> 
        
In collaboration with our partner school, the St. Luke Vocational School in Ghana, we intend to install a solar panel system to ensure the school's self-sufficient power supply. <br>
This initiative will also offer the vocational school students a practical opportunity to learn about the innovative technology of solar energy.

     <p><h2> How do we fund our project? </h2>
    We presented our project at a school event in November and received a lot of interest from parents who generously donated 
    to our cause. During the event, we sold decorated chocolates and handed out flyers that we had made earlier. In the next few months, we want to collect the last donation.
