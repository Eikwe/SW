        <u> <h2> Cable collection for our project </h2></u>
Currently, we are collecting old and broken cables, which we will recycle in collaboration with the Schweinfurt-based organizations "People4Future" and "Agenda2030". 
The funds generated from this initiative will benefit our project, which involves the construction of a solar power plant for the St. Luke's School in Ghana. 
If you have any broken cables lying around, you can hand them in at "Schweinfurter Marktplatz" on May 13th between 10 am and 3 pm. This event is part of the so-called "Zukunftswoche Mainfranken".

<u><h1> "Aktionskunst" (actions art) </h1> </u>
As part of the "Utopia - Art Space for Freedom" exhibition organized by the KulturPackt, we had the opportunity to present our project in an artistic manner. 
    Both the art project featuring the 5th grade's paintings and the solar project were displayed and available for viewing at the town hall. For further information on the philosophy of "Ubuntu," please refer to the sources provided below.

<center> <b> <h3>The utopia behind our project </h3></center></b>
Our project "Our energy gives you energy" is inspired by the African philosophy of Ubuntu. This philosophy states that our own well-being is inseparably linked to the well-being of our community.
Everyday situations such as eating a banana illustrate this <b>connection</b>: from planting to harvesting, numerous people are involved.
What is crucial about Ubuntu is that as human beings, we should support each other to lead a fulfilling and happy life collectively.
<br>
<br> Our project puts these ideas into practice by installing a solar panel system in collaboration with our partner school.
Overall, our project represents a <b>social and ecological utopia</b>.
