     <u><h2> "Aktionskunst" (actions art) </h2> </u>
As part of the "Utopia - Art Space for Freedom" exhibition organized by the KulturPackt, we had the opportunity to present our project in an artistic manner. 
    Both the art project featuring the 5th grade's paintings and the solar project were displayed and available for viewing at the town hall. For further information on the philosophy of "Ubuntu," please refer to the sources provided below.

    The QR codes placed next to the images aroused the visitors'
    interest in our project and directed them to the corresponding sub-page of this website.

<b> <h3>The utopia behind our project </h3></b>
Our project "Our energy gives you energy" is inspired by the African philosophy of Ubuntu. This philosophy states that our own well-being is inseparably linked to the well-being of our community.
Everyday situations such as eating a banana illustrate this <b>connection</b>: from planting to harvesting, numerous people are involved.
What is crucial about Ubuntu is that as human beings, we should support each other to lead a fulfilling and happy life collectively.
<br>
<br> Our project puts these ideas into practice by installing a solar panel system in collaboration with our partner school.
Overall, our project represents a <b>social and ecological utopia</b>.
<br>

At the closing event, we had the opportunity to present our project to a wide audience. <br> <br>
