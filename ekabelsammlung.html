        <u> <h2> Cable collection for our project </h2></u>
        Currently, we are collecting old and broken cables, which we will recycle in collaboration with the Schweinfurt-based organizations "People4Future" and "Agenda2030". 
        The funds generated from this initiative will benefit our project, which involves the construction of a solar power plant for the St. Luke's School in Ghana. 
        If you have any broken cables lying around, you can hand them in at "Schweinfurter Marktplatz" on May 13th between 10 am and 3 pm. This event is part of the so-called "Zukunftswoche Mainfranken".
