Everyone is familiar with the "cable mess" at home: charging and telephone cables, as well as various other connectors, lying around in drawers. Sometimes you don't even know which device a cable belongs to anymore. 

<h3> Cable collection campaign </h3>

        <p style="font-size: 90%;"> The project seminar "Wohn(t)räume - hier und anderswo " of Walther Rathenau Gymnasium aims to collect donations for the <b> construction of a solar power system </b> through a cable collection campaign. This collection event will take place on <b> Saturday, May 13, 2023, from 10 am to 3 pm at the Schweinfurt Marketplace </b> as part of the "Zukunftswoche Mainfranken." Additionally, Rathenau students can drop off cables at the school from May 8 to May 12. The solar project of this student group is supported by the recycling initiative "Agenda 2030" and "People4Future."

<h3> Our Project: Financing a Solar Power System</h3>

    The collected cables will be accepted by Riwald Recycling Franken GmbH in Sennfeld. They will recycle the valuable <b> copper material </b> contained in the cables. The proceeds will directly contribute to our project, the solar power system for our partner school. Through this campaign, we aim to collect the remaining donation funds.<br> <br>
